# HanSa

## Introduction

The HanSa - Hana's Screensaver is a project to control the PC time for children. It is meant to be a replacement for the Windows account manager for family members. Because it sucks that everything is going over Windows server and without Internet it isn't working.

## Overview

HanSa comes with these features:
    - Configurable screensaver that catches all keyboard and mouse inputs that the child cannot CTRL+SHIFT+ESC out of the misery.
    - In the (only by admin editable) configuration file the parent can specify the usage times (Monday to Sunday) and the max. PC time on each day.
    - Parents can unlock the PC with their credentials to allow the child the usage out of the specified times.
    - Parents can prolong the usage time after it expired (also with their credentials).
    - It comes with the HanSa configuration (GUI based) - but the parents can also edit the config file per hand.
    - The screensaver comes up every X minutes and give the child math equations to solve
    - The math is adapting to the childs performance
    - HanSa comes with a GUI to configure the screensaver
